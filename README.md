# Problem Statement

The Airbnb model for housing prcing has proven to be hugely succesful and widely accepted a s being proitable as well as fair. As a new player in the short-stay housing market, I am trying to imitate the pricig pattern of AirBnb for my own properties which are in similar locations. I hope that I can build a model that can replicate such pricing success as well as as in the future try and further access the prices to see whether it is still possible to have a cheaper plan while making adeuate profit irrespective. I do  not have the technical manpower of Airbnb to always carryout market research but I also want to leverage on any financial adjustment made by their team in future pricing in other to constantly be in the loop.

## Solution

1. In other to achieve this, I will build a machine learning model with a very high accuracy. 
2. Based on the findings of the analysis team, I can decide what percentage reduction of price can be applied across board in order to attract more customers as well as maintain profitabiliy.
3. Since I do not have a large workforce, I will also build a monitoring system that constanly checks the performance of our model against current pricing. I achieve this by using the prefect tool for orchestration, this also helps me monitor the entire pipeline from data ingestion to inference, detecting and break in the process.
